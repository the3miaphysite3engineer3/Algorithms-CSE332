# L-Tromino Tiling Algorithm Comparison Report

## Introduction

This report presents a comparative analysis of different algorithms for solving the L-Tromino tiling problem with 3-coloring. The L-Tromino tiling problem is a classic puzzle in combinatorial geometry where the objective is to cover a 2^n × 2^n grid with exactly one cell removed using L-shaped trominoes. Each tromino covers exactly three cells, and no two trominoes overlap. The 3-coloring extension adds the constraint that adjacent trominoes must have different colors, using at most three colors.

Our implementation explores three different algorithmic approaches to solve this problem:
1. Divide and Conquer with Color Assignment
2. Graph Coloring with Constraint Propagation
3. SAT Solver Approach (simplified)

Each algorithm is analyzed based on its time complexity, space requirements, and performance characteristics.

---

## Problem Description

The L-Tromino tiling problem can be formally defined as follows:

**Input:**
- An integer n, defining a 2^n × 2^n grid
- Coordinates (x, y) of a single cell to be removed from the grid

**Output:**
- A valid tiling of the remaining grid using L-shaped trominoes
- A valid 3-coloring of the trominoes such that no two adjacent trominoes share the same color

An L-tromino is an L-shaped tile consisting of three unit squares connected edge-to-edge, forming an "L" shape. The tiling must cover all cells of the grid except the removed cell, with no overlaps between trominoes.

The 3-coloring constraint adds complexity to the problem, requiring that any two trominoes sharing an edge must be assigned different colors, using at most three distinct colors.

---

## Detailed Assumptions

Our implementation makes the following assumptions:

1. **Grid Size**: The grid is always of size 2^n × 2^n, where n is a positive integer. This ensures that the total number of cells in the grid is (2^n)² - 1, which is divisible by 3 after removing one cell.

2. **Missing Cell**: Exactly one cell is removed from the grid. The position of this cell can be specified or randomly chosen.

3. **Tromino Shape**: Each tromino covers exactly three cells and has an L-shape (three connected squares forming an "L").

4. **Complete Coverage**: Every cell except the removed one must be covered by exactly one tromino.

5. **Valid Coloring**: Adjacent trominoes (trominoes sharing an edge) must have different colors, and at most three colors are used.

6. **Adjacency Definition**: Two trominoes are considered adjacent if they share at least one edge between their cells.

7. **Visualization**: The algorithms provide visual output to show the tiling and coloring of the trominoes.

8. **Execution Environment**: The algorithms are executed on a standard computing environment with sufficient memory to store the grid and perform the necessary operations.

## Solution Approaches

### Divide and Conquer Algorithm

#### Description

The Divide and Conquer algorithm approaches the L-Tromino tiling problem by recursively breaking down the grid into smaller subproblems. The key insight is that a 2^n × 2^n grid with one missing cell can be divided into four 2^(n-1) × 2^(n-1) subgrids, where three of the subgrids have a new "missing" cell at the corner adjacent to the center, and the fourth subgrid contains the original missing cell.

For the coloring phase, the algorithm uses a greedy approach to assign colors to trominoes such that no adjacent trominoes share the same color.

#### Pseudo-code

```
function DivideAndConquer(grid, missing_x, missing_y, size):
    if size == 2:
        # Base case: place a single tromino in a 2x2 grid
        Place tromino covering all cells except the missing one
        return
    
    half = size / 2
    center_x = x + half - 1
    center_y = y + half - 1
    
    # Determine which quadrant contains the missing square
    quad_x = 1 if missing_x > center_x else 0
    quad_y = 1 if missing_y > center_y else 0
    
    # Place a tromino at the center, covering one square in each quadrant
    # except the one with the missing square
    Place central tromino
    
    # Recursively tile each quadrant
    for each quadrant:
        if quadrant contains the original missing cell:
            DivideAndConquer(quadrant, original_missing_cell_position, half)
        else:
            DivideAndConquer(quadrant, position_of_center_tromino_in_quadrant, half)
            
function AssignColors(board):
    Build adjacency graph where nodes are tromino IDs and edges connect adjacent trominoes
    
    for each tromino in the board:
        used_colors = colors of adjacent trominoes
        Assign the smallest color number not in used_colors
```

#### Code Implementation

```python
class DivideAndConquerAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, n, missing_x=None, missing_y=None):
        self.board = Board(n, missing_x, missing_y)

        self.assign_colors()
        
        return self.board
    
    def assign_colors(self):
        """Assign colors to trominoes such that no adjacent trominoes have the same color."""
        # Create a graph where nodes are tromino IDs and edges are adjacency relationships
        adjacency = defaultdict(set)
        
        # Find adjacencies
        for i in range(self.board.size):
            for j in range(self.board.size - 1):
                id1 = self.board.board[i, j]
                id2 = self.board.board[i, j+1]
                if id1 > 0 and id2 > 0 and id1 != id2:
                    adjacency[id1].add(id2)
                    adjacency[id2].add(id1)
        
        for i in range(self.board.size - 1):
            for j in range(self.board.size):
                id1 = self.board.board[i, j]
                id2 = self.board.board[i+1, j]

                    adjacency[id1].add(id2)
                    adjacency[id2].add(id1)
        
        # Assign colors using greedy algorithm
        colors = {}
        for tromino_id in range(1, self.board.tromino_count + 1):
            used_colors = {colors.get(adj) for adj in adjacency[tromino_id] if adj in colors}
            
            # Find the first available color
            for color in range(1, 4):  # We only need 3 colors
                if color not in used_colors:
                    colors[tromino_id] = color
                    break

            for j in range(self.board.size):
                if self.board.board[i, j] > 0:
                    self.board.color_board[i, j] = colors[self.board.board[i, j]]
```

### Graph Coloring with Constraint Propagation

#### Description

The Graph Coloring algorithm frames the 3-coloring problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). After placing the trominoes using the divide and conquer approach, it builds an adjacency graph where nodes represent trominoes and edges represent adjacency relationships. It then uses backtracking with constraint propagation to assign colors such that no adjacent trominoes share the same color.

#### Pseudo-code

```
function GraphColoringAlgorithm(n, missing_x, missing_y):
    # Place trominoes using divide and conquer
    board = place_trominoes(n, missing_x, missing_y)
    
    # Build adjacency graph
    adjacency = build_adjacency_graph(board)
    
    # Solve CSP using backtracking
    colors = {}
    solve_csp(adjacency, colors, 1, board.tromino_count)
    
    return board with colors applied

function build_adjacency_graph(board):
    adjacency = empty graph
    
    for each pair of adjacent cells in the board:
        if cells belong to different trominoes:
            add edge between tromino IDs in adjacency graph
    
    return adjacency

function solve_csp(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, total_trominoes):
    if tromino_id > total_trominoes:
        return true  # All trominoes colored
    
    for color in [1, 2, 3]:
        if is_valid_color(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, color):
            colors[tromino_id] = color
            if solve_csp(adjacency, colors, tromino_id + 1, total_trominoes):
                return true
            remove tromino_id from colors  # Backtrack
    
    return false

function is_valid_color(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, color):
    for each adjacent tromino adj in adjacency[tromino_id]:
        if adj is colored and colors[adj] == color:
            return false
    return true
```

### SAT Solver Approach

#### Description

The SAT Solver approach models the problem as a boolean satisfiability problem. While a full SAT solver implementation is complex, our simplified version uses the divide and conquer algorithm for tromino placement and then encodes the 3-coloring problem in a manner similar to how it would be encoded for a SAT solver. The solution is found using backtracking.

#### Pseudo-code

```
function SATSolverAlgorithm(n, missing_x, missing_y):
    # Place trominoes using divide and conquer
    board = place_trominoes(n, missing_x, missing_y)
    
    # Build adjacency graph for SAT encoding
    adjacency = build_adjacency_graph(board)
    
    # Solve using SAT-like backtracking
    colors = {}
    solve_sat_model(adjacency, colors, 1, board.tromino_count)
    
    return board with colors applied

function build_adjacency_graph(board):
    adjacency = empty graph
    
    for each pair of adjacent cells in the board:
        if cells belong to different trominoes:
            add edge between tromino IDs in adjacency graph
    
    return adjacency

function solve_sat_model(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, total_trominoes):
    if tromino_id > total_trominoes:
        return true
    
    for color in [1, 2, 3]:
        if is_valid_color(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, color):
            colors[tromino_id] = color
            if solve_sat_model(adjacency, colors, tromino_id + 1, total_trominoes):
                return true
            remove tromino_id from colors  # Backtrack
    
    return false

function is_valid_color(adjacency, colors, tromino_id, color):
    for each adjacent tromino adj in adjacency[tromino_id]:
        if adj is colored and colors[adj] == color:
            return false
    return true
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Divide and Conquer Algorithm

**Time Complexity:**
- **Tromino Placement**: O(n²), where n is the size of the board (2^k × 2^k).
  - Each recursive call divides the board into four equal parts, and the recurrence relation is T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(1).
  - By the Master Theorem, this gives T(n) = O(n²).
- **Color Assignment**: O(V + E), where V is the number of trominoes (approximately n²/3) and E is the number of adjacency relationships.
  - Building the adjacency graph takes O(n²) time to scan the board.
  - The greedy coloring algorithm takes O(V + E) time.
- **Overall**: O(n²)

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n² + V + E) = O(n²) for storing the board and the adjacency graph.

### Graph Coloring with Constraint Propagation

**Time Complexity:**
- **Tromino Placement**: O(n²), same as the Divide and Conquer algorithm.
- **Building Adjacency Graph**: O(n²) to scan the board and identify adjacencies.
- **CSP Solving**: O(3^V) in the worst case, where V is the number of trominoes.
  - In practice, the number of backtracking steps is often much smaller due to constraint propagation.
- **Overall**: O(n² + 3^V) ≈ O(3^(n²/3)) in the worst case, but typically closer to O(n²) in practice.

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n² + V + E) = O(n²) for storing the board, adjacency graph, and color assignments.

### SAT Solver Approach

**Time Complexity:**
- **Tromino Placement**: O(n²), same as the Divide and Conquer algorithm.
- **Building Adjacency Graph**: O(n²)
- **SAT Solving (simplified)**: O(3^V) in the worst case, similar to the Graph Coloring approach.
- **Overall**: O(n² + 3^V) ≈ O(3^(n²/3)) in the worst case, but typically better in practice.

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n² + V + E) = O(n²) for storing the board, adjacency graph, and variables.

## Conclusion

This study investigated three different algorithmic approaches to solve the L-Tromino tiling problem with 3-coloring. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions:

1. **Tromino Placement Efficiency:**
   All three algorithms use the same divide-and-conquer approach for tromino placement, which is optimal with O(n²) time complexity. This confirms that the divide-and-conquer paradigm is well-suited for tiling problems.

2. **Coloring Strategy Trade-offs:**
   - The greedy coloring approach in the Divide and Conquer algorithm offers the best performance but may not generalize well to more complex constraints.
   - The systematic backtracking in Graph Coloring provides guarantees of finding a valid coloring if one exists, at the cost of potentially exponential runtime.
   - The SAT Solver approach offers the most flexibility for expressing complex constraints but requires sophisticated implementation for full benefits.

3. **Scalability:**
   As the grid size increases, the performance difference between the algorithms becomes more pronounced. The Divide and Conquer algorithm maintains its efficiency advantage, while the constraint-based approaches face increasing computational demands.

4. **Practical Recommendations:**
   - For small to medium grids (up to 16×16), any of the three algorithms is suitable.
   - For larger grids, the Divide and Conquer algorithm is preferred unless additional coloring constraints are present.
   - When complex constraints beyond simple adjacency are required, the SAT Solver approach offers the most flexibility despite its higher computational cost.

5. **Future Directions:**
   - Implementation of a true SAT solver could provide more efficient solutions for complex instances.
   - Parallelization of the backtracking in constraint-based approaches could improve performance.
   - Exploring alternative tiling algorithms beyond divide-and-conquer could yield interesting comparative results.

In summary, the L-Tromino tiling problem with 3-coloring showcases the trade-offs between different algorithmic paradigms. The choice of algorithm should be guided by the specific requirements of the application, including grid size, constraint complexity, and computational resources available.
